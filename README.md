# Rantoni Assets

Everything regarding the game Rantoni that doesn't directly have to do with the game is in here. It's more like a dirty repo where I don't exactly try to keep a super clean history or small git dir size.

## Game References

    - For game feel and gameplay
- Midnight fight express

## Marketing

Just some rough plans for what you can do for marketing. Will probably not be able to do everything.

- Send out steam keys to streamers/youtubers and ask them to play the game
- Youtube Videos (game dev logs) about the game
- Lost Oppai Game Dev with Rantoni mention at the end (probably kinda cheeky, but oh well)
