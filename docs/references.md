## Gameplay

Overall a great reference for what NOT to do is in the game Redeemer, boy oh boy does that game screw up (though such a juice). Not sure if this is a good reference overall `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4`.

- Redeemer
    - For game feel and gameplay
- Midnight fight express
    - gameplay
- Hades
    - Partially for game feel
    - Animation statemachine
- Wizards of Legends
    - Animations
- Akane
    - Not a great gameplay reference, though I think the enemies have really small anticipation, how does that work?
- CrossCode
    - Leveldesign
- Katana Zero
    - Absolutely amazing tutorial
    - Also game juice
- Streets of Rogue
    - Factions and simulation based chaos/complexity
    - Giving different AI's different rules can result in very interesting and fun situations

## Art

- Akane
    - General vibe

    - For the tileset, something like this should work, I also realized we don't really need 2x2 tileset mapping, it's modern so there are clear cuts pretty much everywhere
- Katana Zero
    - General vibe
- Dead Cells
