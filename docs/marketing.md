## Specific unique marketing

- Reach out to Ranton, tell him about the game and also ask if he wants to be part, as for example a story writer (also partially marketing in terms of videos or similar content creation)
- Regardless of whether or not Ranton will actually agree to join, we can definitely do some posts on his subreddit as the game was inspired by him
- Events or leaderboard stuff on discord or some similar form of competition (probably not because it's too much work)
- Lost Oppai Game Dev with Rantoni mention at the end (probably kinda cheeky, but oh well)
    - In this case doing a little bit of marketing for Lost Oppai may actually end up helping this game as well, though probably only way too indirectly and not really worth the extra effort? Well you could at least post it on yarnspinner discord
    - Lost Oppai game dev log with a reveal of the game at the end (though only once the steam page is up!)
- Bevy Community
    - Share on main bevy discord server (in showcase channel for example, if you do gamedev logs then post there as well)
    - Possibly post on some more niche bevy servers like specific crates?
    - Put game on assets page
- If you actually manage to finish this game, consider write Mr. Prime an email telling him about it and that he was a major influence (like a mentor). This isn't really about marketing and more about gratitude, but oh well I just put it here. Also if he notices it and streams it I guess that would be somewhat marketing, though I don't want to write an email with this pretence, so maybe don't.

## General Stuff

- Localize steam page!

Just some rough plans for what you can do for marketing. Will probably not be able to do everything.

- Set up press kit and host on server
- Discord server
- Send out steam keys to streamers/youtubers and ask them to play the game
    - You can also just tell them about your demo, that seems to be more common anyways
- Reach out to press/blogs etc
- Youtube Videos (game dev logs) about the game
    - Preferably not this, it is unlikely to lead to much

## Steam Page

- Absolutely look at games with similar genre and what they are doing
- For the thumbnail, look at
    - Midnight Fight Express
    - Suit for Hire
    - RUINER
    - MADNESS: Project Nexus
    - Akane
    - Redeemer
    - This makes the point: `https://youtu.be/hTG1B5mIRDk?t=1082`
