# Timeline

## Final Prototype (pre-MVP)

Deadline: End of 2024

Fully functioning gameplay, player and 1 enemy, tileset of first area (rail yard, complete tileset) and also some props (doesn't need to include breakable proprs, static ones will do for this milestone). Art direction should be somewhat dialed in at this point.

Some key things will still be missing here:

- No dialogue or story (neither code nor content)
- No menu's or any UI
- No sounds
- No real polish except raw gameplay (and art as much as possible)

## MVP (small vertical slice)

Deadline: March 2025

- Polish the fuck out of the game
- Register as a business (talk with Steuerberater)
- Steam page
- Reach out to Anton

This is all about taking what we have and polishing it to the absolute extreme. We aren't going to add much more stuff in terms of content or features, just making sure that what we got is really good.

- Attacking effects and various other pixel art effects
- Sounds
- Music
- Tutorial
- Menus (main menu, options)
- UI
    - Health bar, look at Redeemer, I like that
- Proper Title Screen/Main Menu
    - I am thinking something similar to CrossCode could work really nicely, see `https://youtu.be/MULE6YCemXs?t=4`
        - Probably way less good and without any of the animations (although they would be nice), but still something like that, player really close, looking far away to a city, setting probably night or at least evening or similar, the city obviously tokoy, actually for that think about something like `https://www.reddit.com/r/KatanaZero/comments/fwbbeu/katana_zero_desktop_setup/#lightbox`
        - If you do decide to go for animations, perhaps blood dripping of the fists of our hero and protagonist? Or street lights of the city moving (or lights in general)
        - Perhaps you could also do rain or something, with a thunder? Bro that would be sick, probably super hard to pull off though, also given that the images need to be huge this might be quite the memory investment, though wait, we only need them at the start of the game (or at least only when we are in the main menu), so we can just throw them out afterwards, yeah so not much of a problem after all I think
    - DomDom?! What do you think? You are up for the task?
    - Also Dead Cells has a really great title screen
    - Redeemer has a lot simpler title screen but that has great atmosphere
- QA (make sure there aren't many bugs, let other playtest)
- Polish all the visuals (shadows, tilesets, maybe characters)
- Gamemplay juice needs to be maxed
    - Hitstop
    - Input Buffering
    - Enemies on walks insta dying
    - Level transitioning working nicely
    - etc. etc.
- Figure out a name for the game dude

Probably a bunch more. I am hoping it won't take that long, but I also have a bunch of exams and stuff around February so I don't think there is going to be too much time for me to spend on the game. Though by my estimations the targeted deadline is achievable.

This is also the point at which we reach out to Anton and ask if he wants to join the team. Before we do that howver we would first create a steam page (still private if that is possible). Depending on his decision the further development will be changed.

## Demo (30min long vertical slice)

Deadline: End of May 2025

- Discord server
- Proper steam page (public)
- Proper Music
- Story
- Put demo on steam

Now we just add content to the game, new levels, new areas, new enemies, story etc. The target here is to have around an hour of gameplay or slightly shorter, then give this to a bunch of playtesters and get feedback on all parts of the game.

The game should be very close to the finished product, so dialogue and story and all that will be implemented during this cycle.

The steam page will also be made public (with trailer and everything). You should also start a Discord server at this point and make videos and shit about it. What about Lost Oppai? If Anton didn't join, then you can finish that and make a devlog and teaser our game at the end.

Here are some decisions that depend on whether Anton is in the team or not

- Steam capsule art, how much do you want to spend?
- Music, how much do you want to spend?
- What is the story gonna be?
- Will I make devlogs? Who is gonna make the trailer?
- How big is the game gonna be (how long)?

If Anton is not in, then I would say don't spend too much time overthinking any of these, don't spend too much money and don't expect a any financial successes. Also aim for a shorter game he didn't join, focus on getting it down rather then making it super good at this point.

On the other hand, if he did join, then you may expect a slightly more financial success and could due with investing a bit more in art and music. You could also try to go for a slightly longer game (though nothing too long, focus is still on finishing it within 1 year).

Also some words to whether or not to make a demo: I was at first quite conflicted about it, but I think a demo of around 30min could be very good. My main issue with it was that if somebody played the demo till the end and liked it enough to decide to buy the game, then they would need to play through the same thing again. But there are two ways to fix it: Just give a pop up at the start of the game that asks if the player has played through the demo and wants to skip the first section, or have the demo be different enough in terms of level and start (story maybe even) that it isn't that bad. I think the first option might be a bit nicer UX, if a player did not play the demo then he will just say no, if he did and doesn't want to skip it he still has the option to and if he does want to skip then there is that. I would prefer to not have that because I could imagine some players would get kinda anxious that they might miss something or whatever but oh well. Maybe this really isn't that bad of a problem to be honest and this just aint's an issue, should probably get feedback on this from players too.

## Steam Next Fest June 9 - 16

Note: All things considred Steam NF doesn't seem to be all _that_ important (still good, but not the end all be all), smaller more specific events may be better, see `https://x.com/kylewbanks/status/1800920295148056789`.

Okay so if everything went according to plan at this point, you kept all your deadlines and the player feedback was really positive and there weren't many bugs, then you can aim for the June Next Fest. You already have a demo, so you can just use that.

If you didn't keep the deadlines or the feedback was extremely negative or there are a tone of bug reports, then don't go for this Next Fest. There will be on sometime in October most likely. The initial time exstimation by me was wrong and you will **not** be able to finish the game within a year. Take your time, fix the bugs, improve the game, add more content, get feedback.

Push the release date by a few months, aim for a launch somewhere in Novemeber.

So what next? Well I don't fucking know, by this point this is well over half a year of me trying to predict the future bro. Think for yourself!
