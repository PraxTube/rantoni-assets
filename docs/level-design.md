## Biomes and Areas

Take a look at Midnight Fight Express if you are running low on ideas, they also got high rises which might provide some good reference.

- Sidestreets of Tokyo
    - This may be too difficult to do in a general way, perhaps reduce this to very specific situations, like for instance, you could just have a straight path (either horizontal or vertical), that would be very easy (lol, relatively) to make
    - Instead you could have something like 
- Interiors?
- City high rises (office buildings and rooms, playing both in the interior as well as on the roofs etc, looking down on the city)
- Sewers?
- Winter region? (Hokkaido maybe? Something with snow would look cool)
- Volcano? (Mr. Fuji? Would be sick, also great visuals)
- Some temple in the mountains (I am picturing some kind of late summer/autumn setting, colorful trees and beatiful nature)

- Shibuya?

Possible locations for gang hideouts:

- Abandoned Factory
- Warehouse by the Docks
- Rooftops of High-rise Buildings
- Old Parking Garage
- Rail Yard
- Construction Site
- Underground Parking Lots
- Forest or Park Hideouts
- Old, Closed Movie Theater
- Closed Subway Station
- Storage Unit Complex
- Deserted Hotel
