# Expenses

- Steam Capsule art
    - Really don't want to spend more than 500 bucks on this
    - Don't be too cheap with this, also we can't really do this later, better to get it right the first time
- Music
    - Bro if I can get noisecream to work on this... dude
    - Though I really, REALLY don't want to spend more then 500 bucks on this, preferable is something like 300 but I doubt that will work
    - Though this can also be budgeted like max 500 at first and then, if there are more whishlists than expected, you can take a bit more cash in the hand and get some more songs, this way you have somewhat of a dynamic budget and don't overhire as badly
- Legal shit? Should we talk with a lawyer or do we need to register a company (~~GmbH?~~ No we should get a Gewerbe)
