# TODO
IMPORTANT: Do not keep polishing the same shit over and over. 
The artstyle is nowhere near polished. Just do something basic. When we'll take the artstyle in a more specific direction, I'll just edit it.

Notes on the art direction:
- desaturated colors, washed darks
- washed dark's temperature varying, depending on context. (railyard cold, ...)
## 1st priority: 
tileset (simple, modern, NOT RESTROFUTURISM, ... unless?) 

notes on retrofuturism vs. purely futuristic: 
- futuristic art and pixel art clash. retrofuturism combines futuristic elements with "retro" (i.e. pixel art) aesthetics. 
[ill keep the art style as simple as possible. changing the style to retro later is probably still fairly simple]

TILES
- plain asphalt (only full tile) x
    - tile variation (cracks, moss, puddles, etc.)
- stone bricks (all tiles) x
- rails

PROPS
- lantern (front, back, side)
- steel boxes
- power poles
- trains

## 2nd priority: 
goon concept art (railyard goon, 6-7 heads tall)
