# The Name of The Game

Just some ideas for a name of the game rather than Rantoni.

- Amuka, similar name to Akane, got the idea from the word Akuma - reversed - Amuka. [Google search results](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&q=Akuma,Amuka,Akane&hl=de) shows that `Amuka` isn't really searched for often, which I guess is good? So the connection to Akuma (devil in japanese) would be that the protagonist is getting viewed by his enemies is a devil or oni or some shit like that. So he got the nickname Amuka from them. Don't have strong feelings about this one though, idea came to while I was doing my morning farmer walks.
- Aruka

Generally, I think you should at least be aware of how easy it is to search for the game. For example, _Redeemer_ is a horrible name for a game, there are like a million different things associated with it so whenever you want to search something related to the game you need to search for _redeemer game_. (this is called SEO btw)

_Dom's notes on this_
I like the idea of making some kind of pun with Akuma or anything content related, but I don't really like it being that similar to Akane (5-letter japanese sounding word starting with A), especially given that the art style is going in a similar direction. 
I think we could even take it in a more Chinese direction. Protagonist is a monk, if things go well, Anton is writing the story and I imagine it would be a lot easier for him if the baseline is a Chinese monk. Maybe even Kung Fu elements in his fighting style. 
An idea: 
Kung Fu Wu De  (功夫无德) - "Kung Fu without morality" 
(Anton said this phrase a few times in his Sifu review I think. Originally he said 功夫武德， which sounds almost the same, but means "morality of martial arts")

> but I don't really like it being that similar to Akane (5-letter japanese sounding word starting with A)

Yeah I get that, I am also not sure if that is going too close, especially because the art style is probably going to be _very_ similar. Though _Akane_ is based the anime _Akira_, which is also 5 letter japanese name starting with A, but yeah Anime -> Game is different to Game -> Game. However I think if the game is good and also similar to Akane in vibe, then it's not necessarily a bad thing that it is similar, one of the biggest critisques people had about Akane is that it didn't have any story, it's just an arcade like game where you kill as many enemies in a small arena as possible.

> I think we could even take it in a more Chinese direction. Protagonist is a monk, if things go well, Anton is writing the story and I imagine it would be a lot easier for him if the baseline is a Chinese monk. Maybe even Kung Fu elements in his fighting style. 

Oh that is pretty interesting. A chinese monk going to tokyo to beat the crap out of gang members, haha I like the sound of that. Also yeah, it would connect more to Anton for sure, only issue is that we need to settle on a few artistic choices before we reach out to Anton, this includes the name of the game (I am not 100% sure on this yet, I don't know how easy it is to change your steam page name and stuff like that, but it's a little more into the future so not that important right now).

> Kung Fu Wu De  (功夫无德) - "Kung Fu without morality" 

I really like this as a kind of undertone of the game, but I don't like it as a game name. Maybe a subtitle? But I think these types of games ever have that. Though this could definitely be used as a mantra throughout the game (I won't define what I mean by that right now, maybe something like "vibe" comes closest).

I think short punchy names are best when it comes to names for this type of game, some examples:

- Akane
- Redeemer
- Ruiner

a little different names but similar vibe:

- My friend Pedro
- Katana Zero
- Midnight Fight Express

I personally prefer the shorter names much more, doesn't have to be a name of a character or anything, but I think that is easiest (also when considering SEO, bro try to search anything for Redeemer or Ruiner and you will get anything but the actual game to show up).

Also as a little aside, when I first read _Kung Fu Wu De_ I said (and also read) _Kung Fu We Do_ haha. I don't know if that is just me or if other english speakers would also auto translate that in their heads.
