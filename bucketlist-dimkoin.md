# TODO

## 1st priority: 
tileset (simple, modern, NOT RESTROFUTURISM, ... unless?) 

notes on retrofuturism vs. purely futuristic: 
- futuristic art and pixel art clash. retrofuturism combines futuristic elements with "retro" (i.e. pixel art) aesthetics. 
[ill keep the art style as simple as possible. changing the style to retro later is probably still fairly simple]
TILES
- plain asphalt (only full tile with some variation [cracks etc])
- stone bricks (all tiles)
- rails
PROPS
- lantern (front, back, side)
- steel boxes
- power poles
- trains

## 2nd priority: 
enemy concept art (railyard goon, 6-7 heads tall)
